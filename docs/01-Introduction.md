# Introduction

Shortening URLs is pretty simple, and a solution that works could be made in an interview hour. However, the point of this exercise is to teach me the steps involved in creating an application in DotNet and putting it into production.

As part of this approach, I hope to become proficient with the following resources: Process

1. Implementing a CI Flow with Github CI/CD
2. Local deployment using Docker
3. Production deployment using Acorn/Kubernetes
4. Marten is used for database development and deployment.
5. Fastendpoints, rather than Asp.net MVC, can be used to increase the application's speed.
6. Performance Testing using K6
7. Open-Telemetry based observability using Honey-Comb
8. UI using NextJS&#x20;
9. Yet to work on Authentication

#### ****[**Problem Statement:** ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]****

1. When the User shares the URL in social media for example on Twitter it counts the character so shortening the URL helps reduce the character
2. You want to know how many people and from what countries visited your social networking site after you shared its URL.
